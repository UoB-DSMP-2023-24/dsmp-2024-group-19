# Setting up the environment

Open the command prompt and navigate to the local github's directory, this is my example:

    cd C:\Users\wwden\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\Group_19_DSMP_Task_B

Assuming you have python3 installed run:

    python -m venv venv

This will take a few minutes to install a vitrual environment, then we will active the virtual environment and install python modules, this will take up to 10 minutes:

    venv\Scripts\Activate.bat
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then to run the jupyter notebook:

    jupyter notebook

Then navitage to http://127.0.0.1:8888/tree
